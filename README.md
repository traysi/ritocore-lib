to-do: integrate x16r into ravencore-lib

Ravencore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript Ravencoin library.

## Principles

Ravencoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Ravencoin network allows for highly resilient Ravencoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement Ravencoin apps and services.

## Get Started

```
npm install ravencore-lib
```

```
bower install ravencore-lib
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [ravencore documentation](http://bitcore.io/guide/). There's also a [ravencore API reference](http://bitcore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each ravencore utility.

## Security

We're using ravencore in production, as are [many others](http://bitcore.io#projects), but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

## Contributing

Please send pull requests for bug fixes, code optimization, and ideas for improvement. For more information on how to contribute, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/underdarkskies/ravencore-lib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a ravencore-lib full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `ravencore-lib.js` and `ravencore-lib.min.js`.

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/underdarkskies/ravencore-lib
cd ravencore-lib
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.
